We are developers, artists, students, and friends.\nHacker Sunday is supposed to be a sustainable hack-a-thon experience,\nunlike your typical 24hr hack-a-thon.\n</p>\n<p>\nThere's no specific topic except you can't hack on “work” projects.\nHacker Sunday is a place where you can explore freely with the support\nof your peers. We want to set aside Sundays for you to try things out\nand genuinely do cool shit. Not do more work for your corporate\noverlords.\n</p>\n</>"
